# Tuturu ascii art

Animates Mayuri from Steins;gate in terminal, in handmade ascii art, saying her famous "tuturu" catchphrase.

The voice is that of the very popular seiyÅ« Kana Hanazawa, and is stored in FLAC in src/raw_sound.h, so that the executable is independant from any external file.

I do NOT own the copyright on that 1.4s track.
